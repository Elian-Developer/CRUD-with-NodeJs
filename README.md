## General Description 📋

 Sale-Soft CRUD:
 
This project consists of a CRUD application for inventory, which allows us to do the basic functions, that is, **CREATE, READ, UPDATE and DELETE** items. This project was built with HTML, Bootstrap, JavaScript, NodeJs technologies and MySQL for database integration.

The CRUD has an option to delete and add any item and it has an option to edit items, on the other hand, the app has a filter browser to speed up the search process for any item using keywords.
